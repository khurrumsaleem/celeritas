Environment variables
=====================

.. note:: Many of these environment variables will eventually be replaced by
   :ref:`inp_control` and :ref:`inp_system` options in Celeritas v1.0 and beyond.

Some pieces of core Celeritas code interrogate the environment for variables to
change system- or output-level behavior. These variables are checked once per
execution, and checking them inserts the key and user-defined value (or empty)
into a diagnostic database saved to Celeritas' JSON output, so the user can
tell what variables are in use or may be useful. A variable marked as a *flag*
has a default value but can be overridden with any boolean value.

.. table:: Environment variables used by Celeritas.

.. [#pr] See :ref:`profiling`
.. [#lg] See :ref:`logging`
.. [#mp] CELER_MEMPOOL_RELEASE_THRESHOLD changes the amount of memory used for
   the device asynchronous memory pool.
.. [#bs] CELER_PERFETTO_BUFFER_SIZE_MB
.. [#ko] This flag, used by ``accel``, omits Celeritas setup and instead kills
   tracks that would have otherwise been offloaded. This capability can be used
   to estimate a maximum speedup by using Celeritas.
.. [#nf] Normally, exceeding the "maximum steps" or interrupting the stepping
   loop will call G4Exception, which normally kills the code. (In external
   frameworks this usually causes a stack trace and core dump.) Instead of
   doing that, kill all the active tracks and print their state. If more tracks
   are buffered, those will continue to transport.

Some of the Celeritas-defined environment variables have prefixes from other
libraries because they directly control the behavior of that library and
nothing else. The ``CELER_DEVICE_ASYNC`` may be needed when running HIP 5.7
or later due to the "beta" nature of hipMallocAsync_: it defaults to "true"
*except* for HIP less than 5.2 (where it is not implemented) or greater than 5.6.

.. _hipMallocAsync: https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/doxygen/html/group___stream_o.html

Environment variables from external libraries can also be referenced by
Celeritas or its apps:

.. table:: Environment variables used by relevant external libraries.

 ======================== ========= ==========================================
 Variable                 Library   Brief description
 ======================== ========= ==========================================
 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES     CUDA      Set the active CUDA device
 HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES      HIP       Set the active HIP device
 G4LEDATA                 Geant4    Path to low-energy EM data
 G4FORCE_RUN_MANAGER_TYPE Geant4    Use MT or Serial thread layout
 G4FORCENUMBEROFTHREADS   Geant4    Set CPU worker thread count
 OMP_NUM_THREADS          OpenMP    Number of threads per process
 ======================== ========= ==========================================

.. note::

   For frameworks integrating Celeritas, these options are configurable via the
   Celeritas API. Before Celeritas is set up for the first time, on a single
   thread access the ``celeritas::environment()`` struct (see
   :ref:`api_system`), and call ``insert`` for the desired key/value pairs.

.. _logging:

Logging
-------

The Celeritas library writes informational messages to ``stderr``. The given
levels can be used with the ``CELER_LOG`` and ``CELER_LOG_LOCAL`` environment
variables to suppress or increase the output. The default is to print
diagnostic messages and higher.

.. table:: Logging levels in increasing severity.

 ========== ==============================================================
 Level      Description
 ========== ==============================================================
 debug      Low-level debugging messages
 diagnostic Diagnostics about current program execution
 status     Program execution status (what stage is beginning)
 info       Important informational messages
 warning    Warnings about unusual events
 error      Something went wrong, but execution can continue
 critical   Something went terribly wrong: program termination imminent
 ========== ==============================================================
