## Title

> [!NOTE]
> The title is the line above this description box and is automatically "suggested" based on your branch name.

**The title should be an imperative statement summarizing its effect on the user.**  (As a statement, it should have a capitalized first word and no trailing punctuation.) These titles are copied directly into [the release notes](https://celeritas-project.github.io/celeritas/user/release-history/v0.6.html).

Examples:
 - Implement the FooBar model
 - Handle errors in track initialization
 - Fix sampling of low-energy Celeritons
 - Refactor code in preparation for new tracker type
 - Add CI support for multiple Geant4 versions

*Please do not add textual or emoji tags, such as 'CI:' or '🐛', to the title.*

## Description

> [!NOTE]
> This text box, which you're currently editing, is the description.

**The description should summarize or enumerate the main changes in the pull request.** Illustrative images (flow charts, performance plots) make excellent additions.

## Labels

> [!NOTE]
> The labels appear to the right of this description. *If you are not a core developer, you will not see them, and you can skip this section*.

If you're a core developer, add one of each label:

- Change type: {bug, documentation, enhancement, minor}
- Category: {app, core, external, field, orange, performance, physics, user}

Some examples of labels corresponding to titles are:
 - enhancement, physics: *Implement the FooBar model*
 - enhancement, orange: *Handle errors in track initialization*
 - bug, physics: *Fix sampling of low-energy Celeritons*
 - minor, orange: *Refactor code in preparation for new tracker type*
 - enhancement, documentation: *Add CI support for multiple Geant4 versions*

See [review process](https://celeritas-project.github.io/celeritas/user/appendix/administration.html#code-review) for descriptions of the labels and requirements.

## Draft status

> [!NOTE]
> The pull request/draft button is immediately below this descrpition.

The "Create pull request" button has an drop-down menu arrow
next to it that lets you change to "Draft pull request". **Select this option if
you want to run further testing before beginning the review process.**
